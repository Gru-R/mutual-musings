excerpt: Our dear readers, here we are again, 5pm on a Monday with our latest melange
  of musings. A big welcome back and thank you, with a special shout out to our first
  official subscriber who is along for the ride 100% voluntarily.  We’ve also used
  a bit of good old fashioned naming and shaming to bring back those friends who were
  once lost, no good trying to leave us now, once you’re in you’re in.
