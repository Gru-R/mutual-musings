excerpt: Issue number 4 knocking at your door fellow friends and mutual musers! It’s
  difficult to start this intro in any other way than with a thank you and wow. Hearing
  your comments and compliments after each issue fills us with a happy pride feeling
  that we’re not sure we knew existed before, but now we know, and our appetite is
  insatiable! We’ve updated our website, we’ve recruited more subscribers, we’ve learnt
  not to do joint up writing. Life is good and we’re moving forward.
