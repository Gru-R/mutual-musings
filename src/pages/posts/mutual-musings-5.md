excerpt: " What’s that we can smell in the air? Wonder, curiosity and excitement...?
  Yes that’s right - it’s the Gemini season, a truly magical time of the year not
  only for all Geminis out there but also their friends and associates, which includes
  you fine folk. Every year since the dawn of time, (or at least since we started
  giving months names) from May 20 to June 21, it’s all about turning energies outwards
  to the social world, meeting new people and exchanging ideas. But as two “intellectually
  curious and broadly observant” gals (not our words - ask The Cut), we welcome you
  into this period with open and loving arms, Summer 2020 lets be having ya!"
