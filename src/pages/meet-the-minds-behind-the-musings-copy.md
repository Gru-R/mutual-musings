Mike and Grubrock met as young girls in primary school, and have enjoyed a long and meaningful friendship since. There’s a fair amount of yin to yang action within this duo: one small and dark, the other tall and fair, one finds it hard to write long musings and the other can’t manage to do the short. One is kind and gentle the other fiery and fierce - this does of course change daily - classic gemini what can we say. 

Our willingness to explore and positive outlooks have drawn us together for over 20 years, with this newsletter being the physical manifestation of our curious minds. May your musings be meaningful and bright.
